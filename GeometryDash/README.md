WHAT IS PYGAME?
---------------
Pygame is a library (a collection of pre-made code) that helps us make games.
It handles things like drawing graphics, detecting keyboard presses, and managing time.


IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
------------------
- CLASS: A blueprint for creating objects (like a cookie cutter)
- OBJECT: An instance of a class (like an actual cookie made from the cutter)
- METHOD: A function that belongs to a class
- VECTOR: A way to store x and y coordinates together (like a point on a graph)
- DELTA TIME (dt): How much time passed since the last frame (makes animations smooth)
